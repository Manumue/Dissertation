  abstract = {Background: Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is a crop of economic
	and nutritious importance in many parts of the world. The lack of
	genomic resources have impeded the advancement of common bean genomics
	and thereby crop improvement. Although concerted efforts from the
	{\dq}Phaseomics{\dq} consortium have resulted in the development
	of several genomic resources, functional studies have continued to
	lag due to the recalcitrance of this crop for genetic transformation.Results:
	Here we describe the use of a bean pod mottle virus (BPMV)-based
	vector for silencing of endogenous genes in common bean as well as
	for protein expression. This BPMV-based vector was originally developed
	for use in soybean. It has been successfully employed for both protein
	expression and gene silencing in this species. We tested this vector
	for applications in common bean by targeting common bean genes encoding
	nodulin 22 and stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase for silencing.
	Our results indicate that the BPMV vector can indeed be employed
	for reverse genetics studies of diverse biological processes in common
	bean. We also used the BPMV-based vector for expressing the green
	fluorescent protein (GFP) in common bean and demonstrate stable GFP
	expression in all common bean tissues where BPMV was detected.Conclusions:
	The availability of this vector is an important advance for the common
	bean research community not only because it provides a rapid means
	for functional studies in common bean, but also because it does so
	without generating genetically modified plants. Here we describe
	the detailed methodology and provide essential guidelines for the
	use of this vector for both gene silencing and protein expression
	in common bean. The entire VIGS procedure can be completed in 4-5
	weeks. {\copyright} 2011 D{\'i}az-Camino et al; licensee BioMed Central

  abstract = {Soybean rust, caused by Phakopsora pachyrhizi Syd., is a major disease
	limiting soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] production in many areas
	of the world. Yield losses of up to 80{\%} have been reported in
	experimental plots in Taiwan. Although the disease is not always
	yield limiting, it has the potential under conducive conditions to
	cause major losses in most soybean-producing countries in the world.
	The threat of P. pachyrhizi to soybean production in the Western
	Hemisphere began in Paraguay in 2001, where the disease was found
	in a limited number of soybean fields in the Parana River basin bordering
	Brazil. Later, in 2004, P. pachyrhizi was found in the continental
	USA. There are approximately 150 species in 53 genera the family
	Fabaceae known to be hosts of P. pachyrhizi. Approximately 120 of
	the known hosts occur in North and Central America and could become
	important in the epidemiology of the disease, serving as a bridge
	or overwintering host between soybean crops. The interaction between
	soybean genotypes and P. pachyrhizi isolates appears to follow gene-for-gene
	theory, with resistance genes controlling resistance to specific
	pathotypes. In addition to soybean, pathotype-specific resistance
	has also been found in a number of perennial Glycine species. Dominant
	genes controlling pathotypespecific resistance to soybean rust have
	been identified and mapped to five loci in the soybean genome, with
	multiple alleles at four loci. Many of the resistance genes have
	become ineffective over time in different geographic areas following
	their deployment into soybean production. The search for more durable
	soybean rust resistance will include research on non-host and/or
	engineered resistance. {\copyright} CAB International 2011.},

	the functions of all genes in the plant genome. A straightforward
	approach to this problem is to reduce or knockout expression of a

	function. Insertional mutagenesis is a useful tool for this type
	of study but is limited by gene redundancy, lethal knockouts, non-tagged
	mutants, and the inability to target the inserted element to a specific
	gene. The efficacy of gene silencing in plants using inverted-repeat
	transgene constructs that encode a hairpin RNA (hpRNA) has been demonstrated
	by a number of groups, and has several advantages over insertional
	mutagenesis. In this paper we describe two improved pHellsgate vectors
	that facilitate rapid generation of hpRNA-encoding constructs, pHellsgate
	4 allows the production of an hpRNA construct in a single step from
	a single polymerase chain reaction product, while pHellsgate 8 requires
	a two-step process via an intermediate vector. We show that these
	vectors are effective at silencing three endogenous genes in Arabidopsis,
	FLOWERING LOCUS C, PHYTOENE DESATURASE and ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 2.
	We also show that a construct of sequences from two genes silences

	tools have been unavailable for application in soybean. This constraint
	was recently alleviated when a novel bean pod mottle virus (BPMV)-based
	system for virus-induced gene silencing in soybean was developed.
	This methodology exploits the plant's ability to silence virus-encoded

	viruses carrying sequences that are identical/near-identical to the
	plant's own genes suppress the expression of the target endogenous
	gene(s). Phenotypes associated with suppression of target sequence
	enable the assignment of functions to specific genes. The strategy
	involves inserting short sequences of target soybean genes into the
	viral genome to generate recombinant vectors. Soybean plants are
	then inoculated with the recombinant vectors, assessed for BPMV propagation
	and silencing of the target genes. Plants silenced for specific targets
	can then be analyzed for various different traits depending upon

  abstract = {The two most commonly used methods to analyze data from real-time,
	quantitative PCR experiments are absolute quantification and relative
	quantification. Absolute quantification determines the input copy
	number, usually by relating the PCR signal to a standard curve. Relative
	quantification relates the PCR signal of the target transcript in
	a treatment group to that of another sample such as an untreated
	control. The 2 -\textgreek{DD}CT method is a convenient way to analyze
	the relative changes in gene expression from real-time quantitative
	PCR experiments. The purpose of this report is to present the derivation,
	assumptions, and applications of the 2 -\textgreek{DD}CT method.
	In addition, we present the derivation and applications of two variations
	of the 2 -\textgreek{DD}CT method that may be useful in the analysis

	pathogenicity genes identified through comparative analyses to fungal
	pathogens that are amenable to genetic manipulation. Functional gene
	analysis tools are needed to understand the infection process of
	these obligate parasites and to confirm whether predicted pathogenicity
	genes could become targets for disease control. We have modified
	an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated in planta-induced transient
	gene silencing (PITGS) assay for use in Triticum spp. (wheat), and
	used this assay to target predicted wheat leaf rust fungus, Puccinia
	triticina (Pt) pathogenicity genes, a MAP kinase (PtMAPK1), a cyclophilin
	(PtCYC1) and calcineurin B (PtCNB), to analyze their roles in disease.
	Agroinfiltration effectively delivered hairpin silencing constructs
	in wheat, leading to the generation of fungal gene-specific siRNA
	molecules in infiltrated leaves, and resulting in up to 70{\%} reduction
	in transcription of the endogenous target genes in superinfected
	Pt. In vivo silencing caused severe disease suppression, compromising
	fungal growth and sporulation, as viewed by confocal microscopy and
	measured by reductions in fungal biomass and emergence of uredinia.
	Interestingly, using the same gene constructs, suppression of infection
	by Puccinia graminis and Puccinia striiformis was also achieved.
	Our results show that A. tumefaciens-mediated PITGS can be used as
	a reverse-genetics tool to discover gene function in rust fungi.

	protection, mostly offered by introgressed host-resistance genes,

	styles of rust fungi. In cereals, Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-induced
	RNAi has emerged as a useful tool to study loss-of-function phenotypes
	of candidate genes. Expression of pathogen-derived gene fragments
	in this system can be used to obtain in planta-generated silencing
	of corresponding genes inside biotrophic pathogens, a technique termed
	host-induced gene silencing (HIGS). Here we test the effectiveness
	of BSMV-mediated HIGS in the wheat leaf rust fungus Puccinia triticina
	(Pt) by targeting three predicted pathogenicity genes, a MAPK, a
	cyclophilin, and a calcineurin regulatory subunit. Inoculation of

	in a suppressed disease phenotype and a reduction in endogenous transcript
	levels of the targeted fungal genes indicating translocation of siRNA
	molecules from host to fungal cells. Efficiency of this host-generated
	trans-specific RNAi was enhanced by using BSMV silencing vectors
	defective in coat protein coupled with introducing fungal gene sequences
	simultaneously in sense and antisense orientation. The disease suppression
	indicated the likely involvement of these fungal genes in pathogenicity.

  abstract = {Weltweit geh�rt die Sojabohne zu einer der wichtigsten Kulturpflanzen.
	Nachdem die Bedeutung des Sojabohnenanbaus in Brasilien seit den
	1980er Jahren zugenommen hat, war Brasilien 2010 der zweitgr��te
	Sojabohnenproduzent hinter den USA. Der Sojabohnenanbau wird durch
	eine Reihe von Schadfaktoren erschwert, von denen der Asiatische
	Sojabohnenrost, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, seit seiner Invasion im Jahr
	2001 die gr��te Bedeutung hat. Bis zu diesem Zeitpunkt war in
	Brasilien nur der eher bedeutungslose Amerikanische Sojabohnenrost,
	Phakopsora meibomiae, bekannt. Wie auch in Asien, f�hrte P. pachyrhizi
	in Brasilien zu enormen Ertragsausf�llen bzw. zus�tzlichen Kosten
	durch Kontroll-Ma�nahmen. Um den Befall einzugrenzen und den Ertrag
	zu sch�tzen, sind Fungizidapplikationen die wichtigste Ma�nahme.
	Sowohl Demethylierungs-Inhibitoren (DMIs) als auch Quinone outside
	Inhibitoren (QoI) stellen dabei die bedeutsamsten und effizientesten
	Wirkstoffgruppen dar. F�r einen m�glichst langfristigen Schutz
	werden diese beiden Klassen h�ufig in Kombination angewandt. W�hrend
	die Effizienz der QoIs unver�ndert geblieben ist, lie� die Wirksamkeit
	der DMIs bald nach. Das Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war es, die
	Sensitivit�t von P. pachyrhizi gegen�ber Fungiziden zu �berpr�fen
	und den genetischen Hintergrund f�r eine m�gliche Adaptation
	zu analysieren. Dabei stellte sich heraus, dass eine Adaptation von
	P. pachyrhizi gegen�ber DMIs besteht, w�hrend die QoIs nicht
	betroffen sind. Aufgrund der genetischen Struktur des cytochrom b
	(cyt b, Zielgen der QoIs) von P. pachyrhizi ist nicht zu erwarten,
	dass QoI-Resistenzen entstehen, wie sie von anderen Pathogenen bekannt
	sind. Die Punktmutationen F129L, G137R und G143A gelten als Hauptresistenzmechanismus
	von phytopathogenen Pilzen gegen�ber QoIs, wobei die G143A Mutation
	zu den h�chsten Resistenzfaktoren f�hrt. Die Ausbildung einer
	G143A Mutation ist nur dann m�glich, falls nach dem Codon 143 des
	cyt b-Gens kein Intron folgt. Im Gegensatz dazu offenbarten die molekularbiologischen
	Untersuchungen am cyp51, dem Zielgen der DMIs, dass verschiedene
	Resistenzmechanismen f�r die Adaptation gegen�ber DMIs verantwortlich
	sind, die z. T. additiv bzw. synergistisch miteinander wirken. Dazu
	geh�ren Punktmutationen des cyp51, die �berexpression des cyp51
	sowie die selektive Expression eines mutierten cyp51-Allels. Insgesamt
	wurden sechs Punktmutationen (F120L, Y131H, Y131F, K142R, I145F und
	I475T) gefunden, die mit einer verringerten Sensitivit�t gegen�ber
	DMIs einhergehen und mit einer Ausnahme stets in bestimmten Kombinationen
	miteinander auftreten. Daneben bewirkte eine drei- bis zehnfache
	�berexpression des cyp51 verschiedener Isolate Unterschiede in
	der Sensitivit�t gegen�ber DMIs. Es wurden Hinweise gefunden,
	dass die Kopienzahl des cyp51 im Genom von P. pachyrhizi einer der
	Mechanismen darstellen k�nnte, der f�r die Modifikation der cyp51-Expression
	verantwortlich ist. Da die Mutationsanalysen und die Ergebnisse zur
	�berexpression nicht alle Sensitivit�tsverschiebungen erkl�ren,
	sind au�er den beschriebenen Resistenzmechanismen weitere Mechanismen
	(z. B. Expression von Effluxtransportern) zu vermuten. Die relativ
	schnelle Anpassung von P. pachyrhizi an DMIs und die Komplexit�t
	der zugrunde liegenden Resistenzmechanismen innerhalb eines Jahrzehnts
	lassen sich auf den enormen Selektionsdruck durch die Behandlung
	gro�er Fl�chen sowie den klonalen, dikaryotischen Lebenszyklus
	und der kurzen Generationsdauer zur�ckf�hren. Bei der Bek�mpfung
	von P. pachyrhizi sollten daher zuk�nftig Fungizide mit verschiedenen
	Wirkmechanismen verwendet werden, um weitere Resistenzausbildung
	und deren Verbreitung zu vermeiden.},

	Asian soybean rust (ASR). A dual approach was taken to examine the
	molecular and biochemical processes occurring during the development
	of appressoria, specialized infection structures by which P. pachyrhizi
	invades a host plant. Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH)
	was utilized to generate a cDNA library enriched for transcripts
	expressed during appressoria formation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
	and mass spectroscopy analysis were used to generate a partial proteome
	of proteins present during appressoria formation.Results: Sequence
	analysis of 1133 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) revealed 238 non-redundant
	ESTs, of which 53{\%} had putative identities assigned. Twenty-nine
	of the non-redundant ESTs were found to be specific to the appressoria-enriched
	cDNA library, and did not occur in a previously constructed germinated
	urediniospore cDNA library. Analysis of proteins against a custom
	database of the appressoria-enriched ESTs plus Basidiomycota EST
	sequences available from NCBI revealed 256 proteins. Fifty-nine of
	these proteins were not previously identified in a partial proteome
	of P. pachyrhizi germinated urediniospores. Genes and proteins identified
	fell into functional categories of metabolism, cell cycle and DNA
	processing, protein fate, cellular transport, cellular communication
	and signal transduction, and cell rescue. However, 38{\%} of ESTs
	and 24{\%} of proteins matched only to hypothetical proteins of unknown
	function, or showed no similarity to sequences in the current NCBI

	revealed eight proteins of unknown function, which possessed classic
	secretion signals. Two of the extracellular proteins are reported

	were identified that are expressed in P. pachyrhizi during appressoria

	in the molecular and biochemical processes in the infection process

	that DH10B has a 13.5-fold higher mutation rate than MG1655, resulting
	from a dramatic increase in insertion sequence (IS) transposition,

	In vascular plants, RNAi molecules trafficking occur between cells

  abstract = {Plant viral vectors are valuable tools for heterologous gene expression,
	and because of virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), they also have
	important applications as reverse genetics tools for gene function
	studies. Viral vectors are especially useful for plants such as soybean
	(Glycine max) that are recalcitrant to transformation. Previously,
	two generations of bean pod mottle virus (BPMV; genus Comovirus)
	vectors have been developed for overexpressing and silencing genes
	in soybean. However, the design of the previous vectors imposes constraints
	that limit their utility. For example, VIGS target sequences must
	be expressed as fusion proteins in the same reading frame as the
	viral polyprotein. This requirement limits the design of VIGS target
	sequences to open reading frames. Furthermore, expression of multiple
	genes or simultaneous silencing of one gene and expression of another
	was not possible. To overcome these and other issues, a new BPMV-based
	vector system was developed to facilitate a variety of applications
	for gene function studies in soybean as well as in common bean (Phaseolus
	vulgaris). These vectors are designed for simultaneous expression
	of multiple foreign genes, insertion of noncoding/antisense sequences,
	and simultaneous expression and silencing. The simultaneous expression
	of green fluorescent protein and silencing of phytoene desaturase
	shows that marker gene-assisted silencing is feasible. These results
	demonstrate the utility of this BPMV vector set for a wide range
	of applications in soybean and common bean, and they have implications
	for improvement of other plant virus-based vector systems. {\copyright}

  abstract = {Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is increasingly being used as
	a reverse genetics tool to study functions of specific plant genes.
	It is especially useful for plants, such as soybean, that are recalcitrant
	to transformation. Previously, Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) was shown
	to be an effective VIGS vector for soybean. However, the reported
	BPMV vector requires in vitro RNA transcription and inoculation,
	which is not reliable or amenable to high-throughput applications.
	To increase the efficiency of the BPMV vector for soybean functional
	genomics, a DNA-based version was developed. Reported here is the
	construction of a Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter-driven BPMV
	vector that is efficient for the study of soybean gene function.
	The selection of a mild rather than a severe BPMV strain greatly
	reduced the symptom interference caused by virus infection. The DNA-based
	BPMV vector was used to silence soybean homologues of genes involved
	in plant defense, translation, and the cytoskeleton in shoots and
	in roots. VIGS of the Actin gene resulted in reduced numbers of Soybean
	mosaic virus infection foci. The results demonstrate the utility
	of this new vector as an efficient tool for a wide range of applications
	for soybean functional genomics. {\copyright} 2009 The American Phytopathological

	validated results. This RqPCRAnalysis tool improved methods developed
	by Genorm and qBASE programs. The algorithm was developed in R language
	and is freely available. The main contributions of RqPCRAnalysis
	tool are: (1) determining the most stable reference genes (REF)-housekeeping
	genes- across biological replicates and technical replicates; (2)
	computing the normalization factor based on REF; (3) computing the
	normalized expression of the genes of interest (GOI), as well as
	rescaling the normalized expression across biological replicates;
	(4) comparing the level expression between samples across biological
	replicates via the test of statistical significance. In this paper
	we describe and demonstrate the available statistical functions for
	practical analysis of quantitative real-time PCR data. Our statistical
	RqPCRAnalysis tool is user-friendly and should help biologist with
